CHESS PROJECT.

Use python 2.7 to run this project.

You may have to build the python-chess library to do this navigate to the python-chess folder in terminal
and run sudo python setup.py install

There are 2 files to run in this

the first is chess_project_dynamic which runs the dynamic chess AI code.
Currently the Code doesn't work brilliantly and most of the fault lies in the ai_search_function.

The second file to run is the chess_project file and this is just a normal chess AI that is coded in a traditional way.
This works rather well and is very hard to beat I still havent!

to insert a move use uci notation such as "a2a3"
